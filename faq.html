            <h3></a>Who is behind this program?</h3>
            <p>This program is run by the people who started RunJumpDev, APAX Software, and Awesome Inc. We have a shared interest in enabling creators and helping people pursue their passions. 
<br/><br/>
<a href="http://runjumpdev.org/" target="_blank">RunJumpDev</a> is Lexington’s local game developers group. It provides....
<br/><br/>
<a href="http://www.awesomeinc.org target="_blank">Awesome Inc</a> exists to grow the technology-driven, creative, entrepreneurial community in Lexington. We provide co-working space that serves as an office for freelancers and startups. Our downtown space also plays host to events like the Kentucky Entrepreneur Hall of Fame reception, the MobileX Conference, Kentucky Space’s HackerSPACE event, IdeaFestival’s IF University, Startup Weekend Lexington, and RunJumpDev’s Global Game Jam.
<br/><br/>
<a href="http://www.apaxsoftware.com" target="_blank">APAX Software</a> is a Lexington Kentucky based software development company that specializes in cutting edge mobile application development, website design and development, and database driven applications.
</p>

 <h3></a>Will I really know how to code after completing a course?</h3>
            <p>Not only will you know how to code, but you will have written a programming application in the language of the course you complete.
<br/><br/>
You don’t have to be a genius to code, you just need to be determined. 
</p>

          <h3>What are the prerequisites for these courses?</h3><p>
All of the courses require that you have basic experience using a computer to input text and manipulate graphics.  All courses also require you to have the ability to work productively for 6+ hours/day in a social, experiential learning environment.
<br/><br/>
Specific Requirements for Unity Gaming Engine Courses: <br/>
<ul>
<li>Laptop that can run Unity [link to system requirements] - limited number of on-site computers available on first-come, first-served basis
<li>Experience playing a variety of video games (platformers, FPS, arcade, puzzle, etc)
</ul>
Specific Requirements for iPhone Courses: <br/>
<ul> 
<li>Mac Laptop with specs...
<li>Experience using an iPhone or iPad or iPod device.
</ul>

</p>

          <h3>Will students receive a certificate upon completion?</h3>
          <p>Much more important than a certificate of completion, students will walk away with their own working application.  As a piece of a developer’s portfolio, this aligns better with the demands of potential employers.</p>
         
          <h3>Will I get a job after completing the course?</h3>
          <p>We don’t make any promises that you will get a job, but upon completion of one of our full length courses you will be a proficient programmer in the framework for the class you participated. We have relationships with many software companies in the region who are constantly looking for qualified programmers.  If you are interested in employment upon completion, we will be happy to refer you to relevant job opportunities.</p>


          <h3>What are some teams that have been through this program before?</h3>
          <p>While this year’s program is slightly different from those in years past, you can check out <a href="http://awesomeinc.org/Blog/a-inc-demo-day-2013" target="_blank">Awesome Inc’s portfolio companies</a>. We strongly encourage you to chat with the founders of these companies, who can share advice on applying, as well as their perspective on the ups and downs of the program.</p>
          <h3>Who are the investors in the program?</h3>
          <p>Our investors are individual angels investors, many with experience as founders of multiple high-growth technology companies.</p>
          <h3>Will my team be required to relocate to Lexington?</h3>
          <p>Yes, your team must relocate to Lexington for the duration of the program. We have found that there is a strong value in physical community and learning from fellow teams who participate in our program. </p>
          <p>To dispel any geographic rumors you may have heard, Kentucky does indeed have the Internet, most people here choose to wear <a href="http://vibramfivefingers.org.uk/tag/sergey-brin-five-fingers" target="_blank">some form of shoes</a>, and companies like HP and CBS Interactive come here to buy startups. In short, <a href="http://kentuckykicksass.com" target="_blank">Kentucky Kicks Ass</a>, and you can, too.</p>
          <h3>When does the program start? How long does it last?</h3>
          <p>The 2013 program is scheduled to start on June 10th and conclude with Demo Day on September 4th. Applications are due May 1st, and teams will be notified of acceptance by May 15th.</p>
          <h3>What if I have more questions? How do I contact someone at Awesome Inc?</h3>
          <p>We're available via email: <a href="mailto:founders@awesomeinc.org?Subject=Awesome%20Inc%20Accelerator">founders@awesomeinc.org</a> or you can reach out on Twitter: <a href="http://twitter.com/awesome_inc">@awesome_inc</a>.</p>
